The solution is to identify and close any conflicting processes running in the background that might interfere with the emulator's startup. This can be done through the Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (macOS).  The specific processes to close will depend on your system and what else is running.  Once these conflicting processes are closed, try running `expo start` again. This should resolve the issue and allow the emulator to launch successfully.
