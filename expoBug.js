While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the Android emulator wouldn't start after running expo start.  The error message in the terminal was unhelpful, simply stating 'Failed to launch emulator'. I checked my Android Studio setup and the emulator configuration, but everything appeared correct.  I tried restarting my computer and the emulator, but the problem persisted. Eventually, I discovered that the issue was caused by a conflict with another Android-related process running in the background. Closing those processes resolved the problem.
